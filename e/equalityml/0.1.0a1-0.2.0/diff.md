 #### Fairness Metric
 * Statistical measureÂ of the output of a machine learning modelÂ based a mathematicalÂ definition of fairness.

 #### Potential Uses
 
 * Bias mitigation methods are employed to address bias in data and/or machine learning models and fairness metrics are needed to mathematically represent the fairness or bias levels of a ML model.

 <sub><b>Table 1:</b> The potential uses for fairness metrics and bias mitigation methods.
 </sub>
 
-<b>Note:</b> Parity is achieved when a fairness metric (such as the percent of positive predictions) have the same value across all levels of a sensitive attribute.  <i>Sensitive attributes</i> are attributes such as race, gender, age, and other patient attributes that are of primary concern when it comes to fairness, and are typically protected by law.

   <br></br>
 
 Through these steps we <b>safeguard against bias</b> by:
 > 1. Creating metrics targeting sources of bias to balance alongside our performance metrics in evaluation, model selection, and monitoring.
 > 2. Applying bias mitigation methods to improve fairness without compromising performance.

 ## EAI `EqualityML` Workflow
-We have conducted extensive literature review and theoretical analysis on dozens of fairness metrics and mitigation methods. Theoretical properties of those fairness mitigation methods were analyzed to determine their suitability under various conditions to create our framework for a pre-processing workflow.

 ## Introduction
-Incorporating bias mitigation methods and fairness metrics into the traditional end-to-end MLOps is called fairness-based machine learning (ML) or fair machine learning. However, fair ML comes with its own challenges. We assembled a diverse team of statisticians and ML experts to provide evidence-based guidance on fairness metrics use/selection and validated code to properly run bias mitigation methods.

 #### Fairness Metric
 * Statistical measureÂ of the output of a machine learning modelÂ based a mathematicalÂ definition of fairness.

 </sub>
 
 #### Bias Mitigation
-* Methods or algorithms applied to a machine learning dataset or model to improve the fairness of the model output. Many mitigation methods have been proposed in the literature, which can be broadly classified into the application of a mitigation method on the data set (pre-processing), in the model fitting (in-processing), and to the model predictions (post-processing).

 #### Potential Uses
 
 * Bias mitigation methods are employed to address bias in data and/or machine learning models and fairness metrics are needed to mathematically represent the fairness or bias levels of a ML model.

-<b>Note:</b> Parity is achieved when a fairness metric (such as the percent of positive predictions) have the same value across all levels of a sensitive attribute.  <i>Sensitive attributes</i> are attributes such as race, gender, age, and other patient attributes that are of primary concern when it comes to fairness, and are typically protected by law.

 Through these steps we <b>safeguard against bias</b> by:

-We recommend assessing the fairness of the same ML model after bias mitigation is applied. By comparing the predictions before and after mitigation, we will be able to assess whether and to what extent the fairness can be improved. Furthermore, the trade-offs between the accuracy and fairness of the machine learning model will be examined.

 ## Guidance on selecting Fairness Metrics
-To make fairness metric selection easy we have provided a few essential questions you must answer to identify the appropriate fairness metric for your use case. [Click here for the questionnaire](https://github.com/EqualityAI/EqualityML/blob/main/Equality%20AI%20Fairness%20Metric%20Selection%20Questionnaire%20%26%20Tree.pdf). Complete the answers to this questionnaire, then refer to the scoring guide to map your inputs to the desired metrics.
